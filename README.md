# Nathans About-Me

## Overview
This project will likely only be a single page html document with a decent amount of CSS styling and a bit of Javascript for dynamic content. While the page is about the author, it's more about the authors interests. Mostly politics and off color jokes. The author
isn't trying to offend anyone it's just that the world is so perplexing these days if he doesn't laugh at some of it he's gonna go crazy himself. Users are invited to take part in an informational quiz that mixes actual facts with alternative ones. Most questions will be yes or no, y or n, type answers. A few will require the user to play a number guessing game. 

## Getting Started
1. Add basic structure to page using HTML
2. Between <head> tags include a link to an external syle sheet called style.css This file should contain all the necessary CSS rules that apply to your page. 
3. Towards the end of the <body> add a <script> tag that connects the html to a app.js file which contains necessary javascript. 
4. Using prompt() and alert() functions ask the user a series of questions. This will likely include a few if/else statements or for loops. 
5. Based on the data they provide through the prompt() return answers that change depending on what data they provide. 
6.
